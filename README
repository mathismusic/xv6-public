### Creating a syscall

You want to create a syscall `ret func(args)`. Do the following:
- add the signature of the call in `defs.h` appropriately
- add the functionality of the calls in `proc.c`
- add the function (but with a different signature - int func(void)!) to the extern list, and to the trap table (array of fptrs) in `syscall.c`
- add a number for your syscall in `syscall.h`
- now the key. In `sysfile.c`, add a function with signature int func(void) that picks up arguments from the stack, and using these calls the function that you wrote in `proc.c`
- add the signature ret func(args) to `user.h`
- add an instance of the macro `SYSCALL` as `SYSCALL(func)` to `usys.S`
And you're done!

### Adding a new file to xv6

Go to the Makefile:

to add file foo.c and add `_foo\` under UPROGS=, and add `foo.c` in EXTRA next to the other c files
to add file bar to the filesystem, go to fs.img and add bar to both places next to the README. (check if necessary): add it to PRINT and EXTRA too.

Installation for the macOS operating system:

- clone the repository
- run `brew install qemu`
- run all three commands listed in https://github.com/nativeos/homebrew-i386-elf-toolchain
- replace the Makefile with https://github.com/ashr123/XV6-MacOS-Makefile/blob/master/Makefile (or change existing makefile, the only changes are (a) line 35 `TOOLPREFIX = i386-elf-`, (b) line 54 `QEMU = $(which qemu-system-i386)` - or see next point, (c) line 79 remove `-Wall` from `CFLAGS`)
- in the Makefile, on line 59, replace the value of variable QEMU with your local installation path (use `which qemu-system-i386` to find it).

and you should be ready to go!

NOTE: we have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
