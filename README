### Creating a syscall

You want to create a syscall `ret func(args)`. Do the following:
- add the signature of the call in `defs.h` appropriately
- add the functionality of the calls in `proc.c`
- add the function (but with a different signature - int func(void)!) to the extern list, and to the trap table (array of fptrs) in `syscall.c`
- add a number for your syscall in `syscall.h`
- now the key. In `sysfile.c`, add a function with signature int func(void) that picks up arguments from the stack, and using these calls the function that you wrote in `proc.c`
- add the signature ret func(args) to `user.h`
- add an instance of the macro `SYSCALL` as `SYSCALL(func)` to `usys.S`
And you're done!

### Adding a new file to xv6

Go to the Makefile:

to add file foo.c and add `_foo\` under UPROGS=, and add `foo.c` in EXTRA next to the other c files
to add file bar to the filesystem, go to fs.img and add bar to both places next to the README. (check if necessary): add it to PRINT and EXTRA too.

Installation for the macOS operating system:

- clone the repository
- run `brew install qemu`
- run all three commands listed in https://github.com/nativeos/homebrew-i386-elf-toolchain
- replace the Makefile with https://github.com/ashr123/XV6-MacOS-Makefile/blob/master/Makefile
- in the Makefile, on line 59, replace the value of variable QEMU with your local installation path (use `which qemu-system-i386` to find it).

and you should be ready to go!

NOTE: we have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

We don't process error reports (see note on top of this file).

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
