// save callee saved registers (ebx, esi, edi, ebp, eip) to kernel stack and then call swtch() to switch to the scheduler context

// Saved registers for kernel context switches. (callee saved registers, essentially)
// Don't need to save all the segment registers (%cs, etc),
// because they are constant across kernel contexts.
// Don't need to save %eax, %ecx, %edx, because the
// x86 convention is that the caller has saved them.
// Contexts are stored at the bottom of the stack they
// describe; the stack pointer is the address of the context.
// The layout of the context matches the layout of the stack in swtch.S
// at the "Switch stacks" comment. Switch doesn't save eip explicitly,
// but it is on the stack and allocproc() manipulates it.
